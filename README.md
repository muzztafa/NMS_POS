# Point of Sale for NMS Pharmacy

This is a standalone Electronic Point of Sale. It uses WPF as its framework and Firebase Realtime Database as its backend. It's part of a freelance project that me and my group are working on. It also includes:

1) An E-Commerce website. (check: nmspharmacy.com)
2) Hybrid mobile apps
3) Rider tracking android app

Note that all connections are through Firebase and no SQL database has been setup locally.

Any suggestion and feedback is highly appreciated.
